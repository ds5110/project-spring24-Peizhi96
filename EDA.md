Maximum Volume (kg): Represented by the blue bars, this indicates the heaviest single shipment of a product in that year. The volume shows fluctuations over the years, with some years seeing significantly higher maximum volumes than others. There isn't a clear trend in volume; it varies from year to year without a consistent increase or decrease.

Maximum Value (USD): Illustrated by the red line with markers, this reflects the most valuable single shipment of a product for each year. Unlike the volume, the value shows a generally increasing trend over the years, suggesting that either the products are becoming more valuable, costs are increasing, or perhaps more expensive products are being shipped.
